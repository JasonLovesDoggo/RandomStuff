### 1. Internet Usage and Communication Comfort
- Observation: The bar graph indicates that as internet usage increases, the level of comfort in communication decreases among students.
- Impact on Hypothesis: This supports the hypothesis that excessive social media use may hinder effective communication skills, as students who spend more time online may struggle with face-to-face interactions.

### 3. Social Media and Emotional Expression
- Observation: The pie chart reveals that a significant majority of students believe social media makes it easier to express their emotions.
- Impact on Hypothesis: This finding suggests that social media may enhance emotional communication, which contradicts the hypothesis that social media diminishes the ability to express emotions. Instead, it indicates a complex relationship where social media can facilitate emotional expression.

### 5. Engagement in Filler Conversations
- Observation: The stacked bar graph shows that students who frequently engage in filler conversations also perceive social media as a valuable tool for maintaining connections.
- Impact on Hypothesis: This supports the hypothesis that social media has changed communication patterns, as filler conversations, while seemingly trivial, are used to sustain relationships, highlighting the evolving nature of social interactions in the digital age.

### 6. Perceived Benefits vs. Drawbacks
- Observation: The horizontal bar graph illustrates a divide in perceptions, with a considerable percentage of students believing that the benefits of social media outweigh its drawbacks.
- Impact on Hypothesis: This indicates that while there are concerns about the negative impact of social media on communication, many students still recognize its advantages, suggesting that the overall effect of social media on communication is nuanced and context-dependent.
